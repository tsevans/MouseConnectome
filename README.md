# Mouse Connectome
CS 4984 Computing The Brain Capstone semester project. 

A [recent paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/45/E9692.full.pdf) titled "Organizing principles for the cerebral cortex network of commissural and association connections" has published and analyzed a comprehensive connectome of the mouse brain, collected from findings in over 185 publications that appeared in the literature since 1974. The goal of this project is to analyze the structural properties of this connectome. We are specifically interested in overlapping mudular structure of the networks.

## Background
The current data for the model of a rat's brain consists of two, bilaterally symmetric cortical domains with identical sets of association connections. Each domain has 5,852 (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?77^{2}-77" title="77^{2}-77" />) possible association connections and 5,929 commissural connections (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?77^{2}" title="77^{2}" />), for a total of 11,740 association connections and 11,858 commissural connections in both domains.
