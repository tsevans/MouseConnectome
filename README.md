# Mouse Connectome
CS 4984 Computing The Brain Capstone semester project. A recent paper titled "Organizing principles for the cerebral cortex network of commissural and association connections" has published and analyzed a comprehensive connectome of the mouse brain, collected from findings in over 185 publications that appeared in the literature since 1974. This project will analyze the structural properties of this connectome.
Code is written in both Golang and Python, depending on team member preference.
